// i386 has the same problem as x86_64 here: a switch that crosses into a
// less privileged ring cannot keep using the kernel stack, so the TSS's
// ss0/esp0 have to be repointed at the incoming process' kernel stack.
// i386 can also do the whole switch in hardware through a task gate, but
// that path is slow and long since dead, so we stay with the software
// swtch() below.
